                <p>
                    Lucky you, youâ€™ve just won ${wheelEarnings+Math.abs(earnings)} at the wheel of fortune! Your net final outcomes in the experiment are thus ${wheelEarnings}.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Note that you will further receive $5 (the show-up reward), and your earnings at the pre-game test.

                    Thanks again for your participation! The experimenter is going to proceed to the payment procedure very soon, thanks for your patience.
